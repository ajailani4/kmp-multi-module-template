# Modularization in a Kotlin Multiplatform Project

## Design
This template groups all modules to be four groups: _core_, _api_, _presentation-android_, and _presentation-ios_. Each module group consists of multiple modulesâ€”or frameworks for iOS apps. For example, _core_ group includes _network_ module and _entity_ module.

- _api_ depends on _core_
- **shared** depends on _core_ and _api_ modules.
- **composeApp** depends on _presentation-android_ and **shared** modules.
- **iosApp** depends on _presentation-ios_ frameworks and **shared** module.

**Note: api module wraps data and domain layers. You can also separate them into distinct modules for data and domain layers. It depends on your requirements.**
